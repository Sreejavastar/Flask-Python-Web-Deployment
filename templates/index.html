		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Chatbots have become increasingly popular in recent years, providing a convenient and accessible means of
			communicating with machines through natural language. In the field of education, chatbots are being
			developed to provide personalized recommendations and feedback to students, helping them to improve their
			learning outcomes. The Chatbot with Student Feedback Recommendation System is one such tool that utilizes AI
			algorithms to provide personalized feedback and recommendations to students.
		</p>

		<h3>Definitions</h3>
		<p>A chatbot is an artificial intelligence software that is designed to interact with humans through a messaging
			interface, using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to
			user queries. A recommendation system is an AI-based system that analyzes user data to provide personalized
			recommendations, based on user preferences and behavior.</p>

		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>The concept of chatbots dates back to the 1960s, with ELIZA being one of the earliest chatbot programs. Since
			then, chatbots have evolved, with advancements in natural language processing, machine learning, and other
			AI technologies enabling more sophisticated chatbot systems. In recent years, chatbots have been applied in
			various fields, including education, to provide personalized assistance to users.</p>

		<h3>Why it is used</h3>
		<p>The Chatbot with Student Feedback Recommendation System is used to provide personalized feedback and
			recommendations to students, based on their academic performance. By analyzing student data, the system can
			identify areas where a student needs to improve and provide specific recommendations on how to do so. This
			can lead to increased engagement, motivation, and ultimately, better academic performance. Additionally, the
			system can help to reduce the workload of academic advisors, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.
